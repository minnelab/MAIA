# Example inventory file for MAIA-Core installation
# Copy this file to 'hosts' and customize it for your setup
#
# For MicroK8s-based installation, you need to define at least:
# - One k8s_master node (the Kubernetes control plane)
# - Optional k8s_worker nodes (additional cluster nodes)
# - Optional nfs_server and nfs_clients for shared storage

# Simple single-node setup
# Uncomment the following if you want a single-node cluster
# maia-server-0

# Multi-node Kubernetes cluster setup
# Define one master node for the Kubernetes control plane
[k8s_master]
maia-server-0

# Define worker nodes that will join the cluster
[k8s_worker]
maia-server-1
maia-server-2
maia-server-3

# Optional: NFS storage configuration
# Define one node as the NFS server
[nfs_server]
maia-server-0

# Define nodes that will mount the NFS share
[nfs_clients]
maia-server-1
maia-server-2
maia-server-3

# Note: Replace maia-server-0, maia-server-1, etc. with your actual
# hostnames or IP addresses. For convenience, you can add these hosts
# to your ~/.ssh/config file as aliases.
