# Example host-specific variables for maia-server-0
# Copy this file to 'maia-server-0.yaml' and customize for your setup

# Define the disk devices to be used for LVM storage
# List all block devices that should be included in the MAIA_Storage volume group
device_list:
  - /dev/sdb
  - /dev/sdc

# Size of the local storage logical volume (maia_0_local)
# Can be specified in GB (g), TB (t), or as a percentage of available space
# Examples: "300g", "1.5t", "100%FREE"
local_storage_size: 300g

# OPTIONAL: Size of the NFS storage logical volume (maia_0)
# Only add this if this host will serve as the NFS server
# This will create a separate logical volume for NFS exports
nfs_storage_size: 1.8t

# Note: Make sure the specified devices exist on the host and are not
# already in use. You can check available devices with:
# lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,TYPE,MOUNTPOINT
