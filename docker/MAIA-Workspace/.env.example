# MAIA Workspace Environment Configuration Template
# 
# This is a template for the .env file that can be placed in your home directory
# to customize your MAIA workspace credentials and other settings.
#
# ⚠️  SECURITY WARNING ⚠️
# This file will contain passwords in PLAINTEXT. This poses security risks:
# - Passwords are stored unencrypted on the filesystem
# - Anyone with access to your home directory can read them
# - Passwords may be included in backups
#
# IMPORTANT: 
# - NEVER commit this file to version control (add to .gitignore)
# - ALWAYS set restrictive permissions: chmod 600 ~/.env
# - Use strong, unique passwords
# - Consider SSH key-based authentication as a more secure alternative
#
# Usage:
#   1. Copy this file to your home directory: cp .env.example ~/.env
#   2. Edit ~/.env with your preferred values
#   3. IMMEDIATELY set secure permissions: chmod 600 ~/.env
#   4. Restart your workspace for changes to take effect
